Programming environment (operating system, programming language, IDE, ...):
I used Python language and jupyter notebook environment.



Description of approach used (max 200 words):
My algortihm is holistic approach to address the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem by combining heuristic methods, 
local search refinement and the exploration capabilities of the Branch and Bound algorithm. I used Local search for improving result of B and B.
It is implemented using  heapq. The results are showcased through the optimization of a sample VRP instances.
It begins with the generation of an initial solution using a heuristic based on the Value-to-Weight ratio. This heuristic helps prioritize customers with a higher value-to-weight ratio,
allowing for efficient allocation of goods to the vehicles.B and B algorithm incorporates a systematic approach to branch out into different potential solutions, utilizing pruning techniques
to eliminate suboptimal routes early in the process. 
It include the concept of linear relaxation, allowing for fractional solutions to be considered, providing additional flexibility.
improve the B and B solution, a local search algorithm is employed. The algorithm iteratively explores small modifications to the routes, evaluating the impact on the overall distance traveled. 
This best modifications are incorporated into the solution, leading to a refined and optimized routing plan.


 


All relevant parameters and their settings:
I used input as TXT file.(I put it in homework folder , it is named as vrp_input.txt).The highest execution time is 1.5 minutes
Nothing else needs to be set before running code



Extra Notes (max 100 words):
I tried  tabu search,simuleting anneling  to get better results,but they dint have more better solution.
Some output are shown in output_representation folder
